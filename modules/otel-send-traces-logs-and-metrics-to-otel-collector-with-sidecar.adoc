= Sending traces, logs and metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector with sidecar injection

You can set up sending telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry Collector instance with sidecar injection.

The {OTELOperator} allows sidecar injection into deployment workloads and automatic configuration of your instrumentation to send telemetry data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

This configuration can be useful for different reasons:

* Telemetry data (like 'exporting, batching, transforming') can be decoupled from application code to avoid additional complexity or processing overhead directly in the application using the following approach.
* The sidecar can be regarded as a universal telemetry processor, thus hiding the differences in the SDK implementations and ensuring uniformity in the telemetry data sent to all the services.
* The purpose of this can also be to generalize the telemetry processor to abstract the different SDK implementation methods and provide consistent telemetry information across services.
* Provides more control over the telemetry data on a per-pod basis. You can customize what data is processed and how it is routed for each application or microservice independently.

.Prerequisites

* The {TempoName} is installed, and a TempoStack instance is deployed.

* You have access to the cluster through the web console or the {oc-first}:

** You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** An active {oc-first} session by a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.

** For {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a project for an OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

<1> This points to the Gateway of the TempoStack instance deployed by using the `<example>` {TempoOperator}.

. Add the `sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true"` annotation to your `Deployment` object. This will inject all the needed environment variables to send data from your workloads to the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.
