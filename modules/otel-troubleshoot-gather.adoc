= Using the must-gather tool

When submitting a support case, it is helpful to include diagnostic information about your cluster for Red Hat Support.

The `must-gather` tool helps you gather diagnostic data for various resources, such as `OpenTelemetryCollectors`, `Instrumentations`, and all related resources like `Deployments`, `Pods`, or `ConfigMaps`.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to save the `must-gather` data.
. Enter the following command to collect the necessary information:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/must-gather -- /usr/bin/must-gather --operator-namespace openshift-opentelemetry-operator
----

[NOTE]
====
When you run `oc adm must-gather`, it creates a new pod on your cluster. The data is collected by this pod. Also, a new directory is created in your current working directory to store the data..
