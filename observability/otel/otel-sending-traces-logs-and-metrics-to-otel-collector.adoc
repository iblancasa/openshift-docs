toc::[]

You can configure the {OTELShortName} to send traces from your application to {TempoName}.

* You have the option to inject an OpenTelemetry Collector instance as a sidecar into your application. This sidecar can send traces either to a Tempo instance or to another OpenTelemetry Collector deployed as a `Deployment`, for instance.
* Alternatively, you can configure your application to send traces directly to an OpenTelemetry Collector deployed as a `Deployment`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Injecting the OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar is different from injecting autoinstrumentation. The sidecar approach runs a separate collector instance alongside your application, while autoinstrumentation automatically instruments your application to collect traces, logs, and metrics without requiring a sidecar.

You can learn more about autoinstrumentation in xref:otel-configuration-of-instrumentation.adoc[OpenTelemetry instrumentation injection]

====


You can set up and use the {OTELShortName} to send traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector or the {TempoName} instance.

Sending traces, logs and metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector is possible with or without sidecar injection.
