A connector connects two pipelines. It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.

<1> Routing conditions written as OTTL statements.

<3> In this example, if `X-Tenant` attribute is not `dev` or `prod`, the telemetry data will be forwarded to those pipelines.

The connector routes exclusively based on OTTL statements, which are limited to resource attributes. Currently, it does not support matching against context values.

=== Troubleshooting the Routing Connector

If you encounter issues with the Routing Connector, use the following troubleshooting steps to help diagnose and resolve common problems.

==== Pipeline not receiving telemetry data

If telemetry data is not being routed to the expected pipeline, check the following:

.Procedure

- Verify the OTTL statement syntax in the routing table: ensure that the `attributes` used in your `statement` match the telemetry resource attributes exactly, including correct attribute names and values. Typos in the OTTL expressions can prevent routing.
+
- Ensure that the destination pipeline exists in the `service.pipelines` configuration: for example, ensure that `traces/dev` or `traces/prod` pipelines are defined correctly in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource.

==== Incorrect routing conditions

If telemetry data is not being routed to the intended pipelines, the routing condition in the OTTL statement might be incorrect.

.Procedure

- Confirm that the attribute used in the condition exists in the telemetry resource: use the <<debug-exporter-to-stdout_{context},Debug Exporter>> to inspect telemetry data and verify that the `X-Tenant` attribute or other used attributes are present and correctly populated.
+
- Test with a simplified condition: try routing based on simpler conditions (e.g., `route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] != ""`) to isolate potential issues with the logic in more complex expressions.

==== Default pipeline is not applied

If telemetry data that doesnâ€™t match any routing conditions is not being routed to the default pipeline, check the following:

.Procedure

- Verify the `default_pipelines` parameter: ensure that `default_pipelines` is correctly defined. For example, the `traces/dev` pipeline should be listed in `default_pipelines`.
+
- Ensure that the attribute used in the routing conditions is correct: if the attribute doesn't exist, the Routing Connector will skip routing and use the default pipeline.

==== Error handling behavior not as expected

If errors are not handled as expected, check the `error_mode` parameter:

.Procedure

- `propagate`: Logs errors and drops the payload. Ensure that the logging level is set to capture these errors.
+
- `ignore`: Ignores the error and attempts to match the next condition. Ensure this behavior matches your intended setup.
+
- `silent`: Does not log errors. If you're not seeing errors in logs, confirm that `silent` is not set in your configuration.

Use verbose logging to gain more insight into how routing decisions are made and where issues may occur in the telemetry flow.

# ...
----

The following outlines the process for how these metrics are calculated:

* Request counts are calculated based on the number of spans observed for each unique combination of dimensions, including errors. Multiple metrics can be aggregated, allowing users to view call counts filtered by specific dimensions such as `service.name` and `span.name`.
* Error counts are derived from request counts that include the `Error Status Code` as a metric dimension.
* Duration is calculated by the difference between the span's start and end times and is placed into the appropriate duration histogram bucket for each unique set of dimensions.

Each metric will include at least the following dimensions, as they are common across all spans:

* service.name
* span.name
* span.kind
* status.code

=== Troubleshooting the Spanmetrics Connector

If you encounter issues with the Spanmetrics Connector, use the following troubleshooting steps to help diagnose and resolve common problems.

==== Missing or incomplete metrics

If the expected metrics (e.g., request count, error count, or duration) are missing or incomplete, consider the following:

.Procedure

-  Check the span data: ensure that the incoming spans contain the required attributes (e.g., `service.name`, `span.kind`, `span.name`) to aggregate the metrics correctly. Missing attributes may result in incomplete metrics.
+
- Validate `metrics_flush_interval` and `metrics_expiration`: ensure the `metrics_flush_interval` is correctly set, and `metrics_expiration` is sufficient. Metrics might not be exported if the expiration time is too short or spans are not consistently received.

==== Incorrect histogram bucket configuration

If the span duration is not being correctly categorized into histogram buckets, check the following:

.Procedure

- Ensure the correct bucket intervals are defined: review the `histogram.buckets` configuration. Adjust the bucket intervals to align with the span durations in your telemetry data. If spans fall outside the specified bucket ranges, they may not be aggregated as expected.
+
- Check the `histogram.unit`: verify that the `histogram.unit` (e.g., `ms` or `s`) matches the desired time unit for recording span durations. Incorrect units could result in unexpected distribution of spans across histogram buckets.

==== Unexpected aggregation behavior

If the metrics are aggregated in a way that does not meet your expectations, review the following:

.Procedure

- Verify `aggregation_temporality`: ensure that the `aggregation_temporality` is set to the appropriate value (`AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_CUMULATIVE` or `AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_DELTA`) depending on your needs. Cumulative aggregation might result in metrics that increase over time, while delta aggregation resets after each export.

==== Metrics not including the expected dimensions

If certain dimensions (e.g., `http.method`, `http.status_code`) are missing from the metrics, check the following:

.Procedure

- Ensure dimensions are correctly specified: review the `dimensions` field in the configuration and ensure all necessary dimensions are listed. If a dimension is missing from this list, it will not be included in the aggregated metrics.
+
- Check `exclude_dimensions`: ensure that the dimensions you expect are not listed in the `exclude_dimensions` field. Excluded dimensions will not appear in the final metrics.

==== Events not showing in the metrics

If event-based metrics (e.g., exception types or messages) are not showing up, check the following:

.Procedure

- Verify `events.enabled`: ensure that `events.enabled` is set to `true` in the configuration. If this parameter is `false`, event metrics will not be generated.
+
- Review event dimensions: make sure that the event attributes you want to track are listed under `events.dimensions`. Only the specified event attributes will be included in the event metrics.

- Check if spans include events: ensure that the incoming spans contain the events you are trying to aggregate, such as `exception.type` and `exception.message`.
