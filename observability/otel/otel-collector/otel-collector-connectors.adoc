A connector connects two pipelines. It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.

[id="routing-connector_{context}"]
== Routing Connector

The Routing Connector routes logs, metrics, and traces to specified pipelines according to resource attributes and their routing conditions, which are written as OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL) statements.

----
<1> Routing conditions written as OTTL statements.
<2> Destination pipelines for routing the matching telemetry data. In this case, the `traces/dev` pipeline when the `X-Tenant` attribute is equal to `dev`.
<3> In this example, if `X-Tenant` attribute is not `dev` or `prod`, the telemetry data will be forwarded to those pipelines.

[NOTE]
====
The connector routes exclusively based on OTTL statements, which are limited to resource attributes. Currently, it does not support matching against context values.

.Parameters used by the Routing Connector
[options="header"]
[cols="a,a,a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Default

|`table`
|Connector routing table containing routing conditions and destination pipelines.
|`[]`

|`table.statement`
|Routing conditions written as OTTL statements.
|N/A

|`table.pipelines`
|Destination pipelines for routing the matching telemetry data.
|N/A

|`default_pipelines`
|Destination pipelines for routing the telemetry data for which no routing condition is satisfied.
|`[]`

|`error_mode`
|Error-handling mode: `propagate` logs an error and drops the payload, `ignore` ignores the condition and attempts to match with the next one, and `silent` is the same as `ignore` but without logging the error.
|`propagate`

|`match_once`
|When set to `true`, the payload is routed only to the first pipeline whose routing condition is met.
|`false`

=== Troubleshooting the Routing Connector

If you encounter issues with the Routing Connector, use the following troubleshooting steps to help diagnose and resolve common problems.

==== Pipeline not receiving telemetry data

If telemetry data is not being routed to the expected pipeline, check the following:

.Procedure

- Verify the OTTL statement syntax in the routing table: ensure that the `attributes` used in your `statement` match the telemetry resource attributes exactly, including correct attribute names and values. Typos in the OTTL expressions can prevent routing.
+
- Ensure that the destination pipeline exists in the `service.pipelines` configuration: for example, ensure that `traces/dev` or `traces/prod` pipelines are defined correctly in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource.

==== Incorrect routing conditions

If telemetry data is not being routed to the intended pipelines, the routing condition in the OTTL statement might be incorrect.

.Procedure

- Confirm that the attribute used in the condition exists in the telemetry resource: use the link:otel-collector-exporters.html#debug-exporter_otel-collector-exporters[Debug exporter] to inspect telemetry data and verify that the `X-Tenant` attribute or other used attributes are present and correctly populated.
+
- Test with a simplified condition: try routing based on simpler conditions (e.g., `route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] != ""`) to isolate potential issues with the logic in more complex expressions.

==== Default pipeline is not applied

If telemetry data that doesnâ€™t match any routing conditions is not being routed to the default pipeline, check the following:

.Procedure

- Verify the `default_pipelines` parameter: ensure that `default_pipelines` is correctly defined. For example, the `traces/dev` pipeline should be listed in `default_pipelines`.
+
- Ensure that the attribute used in the routing conditions is correct: if the attribute doesn't exist, the Routing Connector will skip routing and use the default pipeline.

==== Error handling behavior not as expected

If errors are not handled as expected, check the `error_mode` parameter:

.Procedure

- `propagate`: Logs errors and drops the payload. Ensure that the logging level is set to capture these errors.
+
- `ignore`: Ignores the error and attempts to match the next condition. Ensure this behavior matches your intended setup.
+
- `silent`: Does not log errors. If you're not seeing errors in logs, confirm that `silent` is not set in your configuration.
